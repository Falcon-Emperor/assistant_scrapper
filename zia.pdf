A Nation-Building Journey of 40 Years
Zia Khan was born in Sialkot in 1961 in an army garrison. His father the late Lt.
Col. Inam Ullah Khan was an army officer who had been posted to Sialkot in an
artillery regiment. The family moved throughout Pakistan in different positions.
The events and tragedy of December 1971 had a deep impact on his thinking and
psyche. He felt that he had to do something to turn the future of his beloved
Pakistan around. However, exactly what needed to be done remained a mystery
to him.
Zia completed his matriculation from Habib Public School in Karachi in 1977 in
the first division. For the next few years, he knew that he would spend his life
working for the betterment of his country but the specifics of the solution eluded
him. First, he thought that he would join the army and become a great worrier
however after careful thought he concluded that this would not address the
issues facing the country. Becoming a politician was another option considered
but after careful consideration was rejected. There came the period when he
thought that becoming a businessman and financial wizard might help him
transform the country. However, later he realized that this might not be enough.
By 1985 Zia Khan had come to realize that the reason Pakistan and other Muslim
nations were behind the West and other nations was because of being way
behind in technology and education. This downward trend started way back in
the 15th century when we failed to adopt the printing press and other
technologies. Then we missed the first, second, and third industrial revolutions,
resulting in the current state of affairs. This degeneration of society cannot be
resolved with political, economic, religious, educational, or military reforms
alone. A movement to transform the culture is required which creates a love of
knowledge and technology in the masses. It may take a generation or two to
achieve its objectives but it is the only way.
Zia now had the realization of what needed to be done however he also realized
that he was unfit to start such a movement. He was an average student with very
limited capabilities. However, one thing was decided in his mind that he would
spend the rest of his life pursuing this goal with complete disregard for personal
benefits and goals. He would not focus on raising a family or getting a good job or
what other people do but focus 16 hours a day and 7 days a week on achieving
this one national objective.
Zia had decided to go to the USA to get the best possible interdisciplinary
education. The plan was to develop expertise in business, engineering,
accounting, finance, and economics. After completing his Master's in Economicsfrom Karachi, in 1987 he was admitted in triple master's degrees at Arizona State
University (ASU) i.e. MBA, MS, and MAC, and also became a Certified Public
Accountant (CPA) and Certified Management Accountant (CMA) in the USA. By
December 1992 he had completed these and was ready to take on the world.
At the start of 1993 Zia moved to Silicon Valley and with his friends incorporated
Xenosys Corporation in California. He did not opt to apply for a green card but
preferred to work on a temporary worker H1 visa. The company’s office was in
Sunnyvale and it worked on hardware and software solutions. After 1995 the
main focus was on Java technologies with Intel and other companies as its clients.
By the end of 1999 Zia had gained a lot of experience in technology as well as in
business therefore he thought it was now time to move back to Pakistan to start
the nation-building movement to transform Pakistan.
In October of 1999, Zia returned to Karachi intending to set up a technology
company but soon realized that the skill level of most IT graduates in Pakistan
was not up to the mark. After teaching in several institutions he also realized that
they were not the solution but the source of the problem. To try to make an
impact he started teaching to anyone willing to listen. It started with free classes
being held on the stairs of multi-storied buildings. But soon Sir Syed University
offered their campus for these free classes on Sundays. When the word got
around about free classes so many people started showing up that it became also
impossible to manage and hold these classes. To reduce the size of the students
the university started charging Rs. 2,500 per semester, which the university kept
to cover their expenses. After the first semester, the realization came that more
teachers were needed; therefore the best students of the first semester were
selected to become teachers. To pay these new teachers the university agreed to
allocate a budget of 40% of the fee for the teachers. Zia’s role was that of teacher
trainer, manager, and author of syllabi.
A new working model was being formed where the space of universities and
institutions was used on Sundays to teach at extremely low fees, with all teachers
being homegrown. This model was replicated all over Karachi with tens of
institutions participating. It system also started spreading to other cities like
Hyderabad, Lahore, and Quetta. Zia was himself going to other cities to teach free
of cost.
By September of 2001 the movement with the brand name of “Operation Bader”
was growing exponentially and spreading like wildfire all across the country with
more than 20 institutions participating and tens of thousands of students
participating in the eighteen-month program. The students were getting
good-paying jobs domestically and internationally without even completing the
program.
With 9/11 everything changed. International companies stopped giving software
development contracts to Pakistani companies. Western countries stopped giving
visas to Pakistani software developers. Most Pakistani software companies had to
close shops because of a lack of business, resulting in massive unemployment ofsoftware developers in Pakistan. As a result, the interest of students in Operation
Badar plunged. The student body was reduced to a few hundred students.
For the next decade, the movement was reduced to a single institution i.e. Sir
Syed University with a few hundred students being taught on Sundays. However,
the bright side of this winter was a core team of battle-hardened core group was
formed which had the confidence that they could survive under any circumstance
and carry the mission forward.
With freelancing picking up globally, slowly the environment started changing in
Pakistan. Some of Zia’s students started making good money while working for
international companies and startups on freelancing platforms. International
contracts again started flowing into Pakistani companies thus creating domestic
jobs. The expansion of the movement again started when new institutions
started joining the cause. A breakthrough was achieved when Saylani Welfare
Trust joined the movement and started offering free classes in 2013.
In 2018 Dr. Arif Alvi became the President of Pakistan after the new government
took power in Pakistan. He had an extreme interest in technology and as a result,
the Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) was
born. PIAIC has trained thousands of students in cutting-edge technologies and is
continuing to do so. You can also take admissions in PIAIC by visiting the website

In 2023 the team and Governor Sindh Kamran Khan Tessori started the Initiative
for Artificial Intelligence, Web 3.0 & Metaverse in Governor House Sindh in
Karachi. More than 500,000 students have applied for this free one-year
program. All the applicants have appeared in the entrance examinations. 50,000
students have qualified for onsite classes, and the rest will join the online classes.
The classes in this program are about to start. The complete details about the
program are available at https://www.governorsindh.com/
